# TSA-website
Description:
    This will be an idea of what the website should look like for the Craighead Forest Park.
How to access the files:
    So for this, there are 2 branches on the repository, one called index, and one called main. 
    on Main is where you will find the codes, so you just click and the code will appear there. 
    I'm pretty sure you can also download it, and everything but Im not really sure.. :\

HTML:
    So here are some of the commands/tags and what they do:
    <a></a> => This is for hyperlinks, used to connect files to each other (you will see this on the menu)
    <p></p> this is for adding paragraph
    <li></li> This is for creating unordered lists
    <div></div> This will create an division, which is kinda like organizing a bunch of the information
    - Most of these tags can also have a class assigned, like for the menu I made the class menu, and for the bigger thing called enterteinment, all of this will be able to change the look of the code once we use css.
    - These tags can also have an id, like we also wee on the <div> groups that I made on index.html, these will be used to be able to get to them for the js language.
